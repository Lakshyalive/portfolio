  // Desktop / PC stuff
  desktop: `The desktop: where code compiles, tabs multiply, and most of my Python work happens in Jupyter Notebook or Colab. I train small models, poke at datasets, and occasionally enter Kaggle challenge mode. It looks productive. It sometimes is.
<br><br><strong>Repos:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Lakshyalive" target="_blank">github.com/Lakshyalive</a>
<br><em>Warning:</em> tampering may spawn dependency hell.`,

  // Education and achievements
CSdegree: `Pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (specialization: AI). Degree in progress — and yes, I will loudly announce it when it’s done.`,
  // Furniture and living-room banter
  sofa: `That's my sofa — where I watch ML walkthroughs pretending to understand everything, coffee in hand and confidence at 12%. Occasionally, I just sit here and do nothing.`,
  chair: `A loyal chair — it supports my back and my bad habits equally well.`,

  // Television / inspiration
  "T.V": `That's my TV. It alternates between deep tech documentaries and brain-rotting Family Guy marathons. When it's not teaching me something, it's teaching me nothing. Also doubles as my gaming monitor — Cyberpunk 2077, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Battlefield... and occasionally, regret.`,

  // Bedroom
  bed: `This is my bed — where I plan world-changing projects and then forget them by morning. Half the time I’m just doomscrolling and pretending it’s research.`,

  // Resume & projects shelf
  resume: `My resume lives online — concise, honest, and slightly hopeful. For now, grab my GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Lakshyalive" target="_blank">github.com/Lakshyalive</a>. If you want the actual PDF, ask and I will stop procrastinating long enough to upload it.`,
 "projects ": `Built this portfolio from scratch. Currently focusing on ML challenges — most recent result: MAE 0.05558 on a dataset with over 500,000 rows (Kaggle). These are the concrete examples of my hands-on experience.`,

  // Misc labeled objects from the map
  plant1: `Plant: placing it here improves feng shui by exactly 0.7% — that’s science-y enough.`,
  plant2: `Another plant, for symmetry and for moral support during long refactors.`,
  plant3: `A plant. I water it sometimes. It judges my commit messages in silence.`,
  plant4: `Plant: Low-maintenance legend — thrives on neglect and passive praise.`,
  
  // About / Player / avatar
  "About me": `That's me — Lakshya. College student trying to make machines smarter while forgetting where my own charger is. Into ML, DL, and whatever else keeps the GPU warm.`,

  // Skills / niche cards around the room
"skills table": `I work primarily in Python using Jupyter and Colab for end-to-end ML: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation. Comfortable with supervised methods (Random Forest, Linear Regression), cross-validation, basic SQL.`,
